# Flasky!

An Flask server we'll build day-by-day to handle requests about dogs and cats!

## Note about testing
This implementation differs from core in that it takes in a list of cats to the create cat endpoint (see `create_cat` function in the [`cat_routes.py` file](https://github.com/kelsey-steven-ada/ac2-flasky-final/blob/ocelots/app/routes/cat_routes.py))
